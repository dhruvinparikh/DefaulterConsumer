# DefaulterConsumer

This is a hydro consumer management console JAVA application.
PS. : In this application the sorting of records based on date in ascending and descending order is not done using available related inbuilt library classes; instead I have sorted date by coding its logic which is there in Testconsumer.java

Clone it, Open up in netbeans(recomended) or eclipse and play with the application!
